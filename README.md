# DigitalHub Website Interview Assessment

This website demonstrates a comprehensive task management application built using modern technologies.

## Overview

This application utilizes the following technologies:

- **Vite:** For streamlined build processes and development experience.
- **Zustand:** For efficient state management with predictable updates.
- **React Router DOM:** For intuitive navigation and routing between components.
- **Protected Routes (Optional):** For enhanced security by restricting access to specific areas based on user authentication (implementation details might vary depending on the assessment requirements).
- **Error Screen:** To gracefully handle invalid navigation attempts.
- **Local Storage:** For persistent data storage to ensure tasks remain accessible even after browser restarts.
- **TypeScript:** Enhanced code maintainability, type safety, and improved developer experience.

## Features

- **Task Management:**
  - Create new tasks.
  - Update existing tasks (title, description, status).
  - Delete tasks.
- **Status-Based Color Coding (Optional):** Visually distinguished tasks based on their current status (implementation details might vary depending on your approach).
- **Sorting:**
  - Sort tasks by date (ascending or descending).
  - Sort tasks by status (ascending or descending).
- **Local Storage:** Persistent data storage to ensure tasks remain accessible even after browser restarts.
- **TypeScript:** Enhanced code maintainability, type safety, and improved developer experience.
