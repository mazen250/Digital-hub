# DigitalHub Website Interview Assessment

This website demonstrates a comprehensive task management application built using modern technologies.

## Overview

This application utilizes the following technologies:

- **Vite:** For streamlined build processes and development experience.
- **Zustand:** For efficient state management with predictable updates.
- **React Router DOM:** For intuitive navigation and routing between components.
- **Protected Routes (Optional):** only login screen is visible until the user log in (fake data).
- **Error Screen:** To gracefully handle invalid navigation attempts.
- **Local Storage:** For persistent data storage to ensure tasks remain accessible even after browser restarts.
- **TypeScript:** Enhanced code maintainability, type safety, and improved developer experience.
